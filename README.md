# What is Post Machine?
It is a machine model in computer science, especially in automata theory. It can be said that it is very similar to the Turing machine in structure, even almost the same, except for minor differences. It was developed independently by Alan Turing, who developed the Turing machine. In this sense, the Post machine is also referred to as the Post-Turing machine in some sources.
Similar to the tape logic used in the Turing machine, the Post machine also has boxes. It can be thought of as a production line with an infinite number of boxes in two directions. That is, access to the boxes is sequential, and the boxes can move in either direction, forward or backward. The post machine starts with the assumption that an employee works from boxes on the production line.
In the post machine, there are infinite boxes in the initial state, but a finite part is considered signed and the remaining infinite part is considered unsigned. In other words, if we want to have information in the memory of our machine in the initial state, we mark this information in the boxes. The remaining boxes are unchecked.
